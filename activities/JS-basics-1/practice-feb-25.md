# JavaScript Function Assignment: String Length Checker

## Objective

Create a JavaScript function that takes an input and:

If the input is a string, logs its length in the format:

```Length of the input "string-value" is some-number.```

If the input is not a string (e.g., object, symbol, null, number, etc.), logs a message stating that a string is required.

## Instructions

Write a function named ```checkStringLength``` that accepts one parameter.

Inside the function, determine if the input is a string.

If it is a string, print the required message including its actual length.

If it is not a string, print an error message stating:

```Input type is wrong. A string is required.```

## Example Usage

```checkStringLength("Hello");```
// Output: Length of the input "Hello" is 5.

```checkStringLength(42);```
// Output: Input type is wrong. A string is required.

```checkStringLength(null);```
// Output: Input type is wrong. A string is required.

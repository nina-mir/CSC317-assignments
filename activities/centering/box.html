        <p> Powering over 6.3 million websites and countless APIs, Node.js is an effective cornerstone for modern
            applications including Walmart and Netflix. With over 2 billion annual downloads, it is one of the most used
            web development tools today (OpenJS Foundation). It is an excellent choice for building high-performance
            applications, however, we know from experience that it takes significant expertise to manage, operate and
            scale an application.
        </p>
        <p>Over the years, Platformatic's co-founders Luca Maraschi and Matteo Collina have worked with dozens of
            engineering teams at Fortune 500 companies to architect their most important Node.js applications. As part
            of the Node.js Technical Steering Committee, Matteo is immensely privileged to have a front row seat to the
            Node community and its evolving needs. If you’ve built Node.js applications before, you’ve probably run his
            code. The modules he maintains are downloaded 2.6 billion times per month, making him solely responsible for
            approximately 1/100 of all npm traffic.

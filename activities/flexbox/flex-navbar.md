Create a responsive navigation bar using Flexbox in HTML and CSS. 

- The navigation bar should contain a logo on the left and three links (Home, About, Contact) on the right. 
- The navigation links should be horizontally aligned. On smaller screens (less than 600px wide), the links should stack vertically and take up the full width of the container.
